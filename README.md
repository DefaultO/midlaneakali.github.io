## aka. first ever seen game concept of something like this by me
##### Forked from https://github.com/midlaneakali
A turn-based Minesweeper Game from [@midlaneakali](https://github.com/midlaneakali).
You beat your opponent by finding 26 flags. If the clicked tile isn't a flag, it's your opponents turn!
You get a hint where a flag could be by the tiles that have a number on them. These Numbers tell you how much Flags are next to that tile.

Main Goal for me is to learn new stuff while coding around the base. This also means fixing already known Bugs and making this even playable on Android and iOS Browsers.
- [ ] Make it work on mobile devices
- [ ] Create a nice Front-end
- [ ] Implement more features
- [ ] Peer to Peer Version since I am really not interested to host a Server (maybe!)
